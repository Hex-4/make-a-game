# How To Use This Book

In this book, you learn through Mark Brown's [three step protocol](https://youtu.be/vFjXKOXdgGo):

* [ ] Learn the ABSOLUTE BASICS
* [ ] Practice though repetition
* [ ] As you make more projects, you'll need to learn more things

You'll find that we return to this a lot - it's a very good system!

There are a few other elements:

<details>

<summary>Do the above</summary>

Most tutorials have you ping-ponging between the software and the application - this fixes that by giving you dedicated points to do the above - if you forget what to do, the dropdown will summarise the steps above.

</details>

{% hint style="success" %}
This is an important reminder - it might mean to save your work, or double-check your code.
{% endhint %}

<details>

<summary>Hint</summary>

You'll find these in the Practice segment - I highly recomend trying to do the projects by yourself, but if you need some help, open these!

</details>

Alright - let's get started!
