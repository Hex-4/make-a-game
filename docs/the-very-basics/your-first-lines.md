# Your First Lines

Hey! First, open the [online compiler](https://www.online-python.com/PlAYfpvTqL) in a new tab. This is Python, a simple yet powerful programming language that is very similar to other ones that you will use in this book.

Then type your first line of code:

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

And hit run! It prints `Hello, world!` to the terminal. Let's break this down.

<details>

<summary>New function: <code>print(String)</code></summary>

This is a built-in Python function. It takes one argument (a `String`) and prints it to the terminal.

</details>

<details>

<summary>New concept: Arguments</summary>

Arguments are like extra info for a function. They go inside parentheses like this:

`foo(arg)`

You can pass multiple arguments into a function:&#x20;

`foo(arg1,arg2)`

</details>

<details>

<summary>New data type: <code>String</code>s</summary>

A string is, well, a string of characters. They are surrounded by quotes like this:

`"This is a string, it can have a lot of ðŸŽ‰ different ðŸŽ‰ characters and they can be any length"`

</details>

Now, try to change the text in the `print()` statement. Maybe add another one - tell a short story!
